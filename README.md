useful shell scripts


###quickdbbackup.sh###  

A tiny mysql single db backup script which outputs date/time stampted sql files ideal for automation with cron


###install_oracle10g.sh###  

A script to automate most of the steps involved in installing Oracle10g on Centos5, ostensibly in preparation for installation of Blackboard 8 Enterprise, but certainly not restricted to that purpose. 
Based for the most part on the information learned in a blog post by Kamran Agayev and some sections of his shell script installer (http://kamranagayev.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/step-by-step-installing-oracle-database-10g-release-2-on-linux-centos-and-automate-the-installation-using-linux-shell-script/  ...or http://bit.ly/V4um6+)
